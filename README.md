# `BlockEntity` Render Distance

By default, most block entities (e.g. banners) can only be seen from 64 blocks away.
This mod allows you to freely control the render distance.

## Configuration
To change the amount by which the default render distance is modified:
1. Stop your current Minecraft session
2. Go to your `/config/` folder which is located in your Minecraft directory
3. Edit the `blockentityrenderdistance.properties` file
4. Save the config and restart your game

```MiniYAML
# The amount by which the default render distance is modified
renderdistance.modifier=1.0
```
